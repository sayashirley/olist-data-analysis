# Analysis Scripts Folder

This folder contains R scripts used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization. Each script is organized to address specific parts of the analysis:
- `eda_analysis.R`: Initial exploration of the dataset, including summary statistics and trend identification.
- `final_analysis.R`: Consolidated analysis and creation of key insights.

Each script is annotated to ensure reproducibility and clarity for viewers.
