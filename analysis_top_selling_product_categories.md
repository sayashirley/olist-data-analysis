# Analysis of Top-Selling Product Categories per Year (2016â€“2018)

## 1. Problem Statement

What are the top-selling product categories by revenue for each year from 2016 to 2018? This analysis will help identify product category trends, providing insights for inventory planning and promotional strategies.

## 2. Datasets
- `orders_cleaned`
- `order_items`
- `products`
- `product_category_name_translation`

## 3. Methodology

The analysis was conducted using SQL to organise data and provide the following insights:

- Top product categories and rank changes, used for **data visualisation**.
  
- Percentage contribution of the top 10 product categories to the total annual revenue, used for **descriptive statistics** and industry-relevant analysis. 

Below, is a full breakdown of the SQL code used to return the top 10 product categories for each year. The full SQL code used to conduct this analysis can be found [here](sql_queries/top_selling_categories.sql) and [here](sql_queries/revenue_contribution.sql).

### CTE 1: Calculating Revenue per Product Category by Year

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** named `revenue_data` was created to calculate the total revenue per product category for each year. The key steps in this process include:

1. **Extracting Year**:

    Extracted the **year** from the `order_purchase_timestamp` in the `orders_cleaned` dataset.

2. **Connecting Datasets**:

    - The `orders_cleaned` dataset was joined with `order_items` to retrieve order details, including product prices and freight costs.
    
    - The `order_items` dataset was then linked to `products` to obtain category names.
    
    - The `products` dataset was mapped to `product_category_name_translation` to convert Portuguese product category names to English.

3. **Calculating Total Revenue**:

    Revenue was calculated as the **sum of product price and freight value** for each product category within a given year.

### CTE 2: Ranking Product Categories by Revenue

A second CTE, `ranked_data`, was created to rank product categories based on total revenue. This step involved:

1. **Applying the Ranking Function**:

    The `RANK()` window function was used to assign a rank to each product category within each year, ordering them by revenue in **descending order**.

2. **Rounding Revenue Values**:

    Revenue values were rounded to two decimals to align with standard financial reporting.

### Main Query: Filtering the Top 10 Categories

The final query retrieved the **top 10 product categories per year** based on revenue. The key steps include:

1. **Filtering by Rank**:

   - Only product categories ranked **1 to 10** were selected.

2. **Sorting for Readability**:

   - Results were ordered by **year** and then by **category rank**, ensuring a clear view of the highest-performing product categories each year.

## 4. Results

The query returned the top 10 product categories with the highest aggregate revenue for each year between 2016 and 2018 respectively. *(see Figure 1 in Section 5: Visualisations)*
Using this table, a bar chart was created to visualise  each year *(see Figure 2.0-2.2 in Section 5: Visualisations)*, as well as the following ribbon chart visualising rank changes and trends during this period.

The analysis of top-selling product categories over the three-year period from 2016 to 2018 revealed several key trends, highlighting both consistent performers and shifting consumer preferences. It provides valuable insights into which categories demonstrated growth and which ones struggled to maintain their top placements.  

Among the most notable findings was the consistent performance of certain categories that maintained their presence in the top 10 rankings throughout all three years. **Health & Beauty** emerged as a standout category, steadily climbing from **#3 in 2016 to #1 in 2018**. Similarly, **Watches & Gifts** demonstrated continuous improvement, rising from **#7 in 2016 to #2 in 2018**. **Sports & Leisure** also performed consistently well, peaking at **#3 in 2017**. On the other hand, **Furniture & Decor**, which started as the **top category in 2016**, experienced a decline, dropping to **#7 in 2017 and remaining there in 2018**. These categories collectively demonstrated strong and sustained consumer demand over the period.  

In addition to the consistent performers, several emerging categories entered the rankings in 2017 and showed strong growth potential. **Bed, Bath & Table** took first place in **2017** and remained popular **in 2018 at #3**. Similarly, **Computers & Accessories** and **Housewares** gained traction, ranking at **#5 and #10 in 2017**, respectively, with **Housewares** improving to **#6 in 2018**. These trends suggest a shift in consumer purchasing behavior, with increasing demand for home-related and tech-focused products.  

However, not all categories maintained their momentum. Some experienced significant declines or dropped out of the top 10 ranks entirely. **Perfumery**, which ranked **#2 in 2016**, fell out of the rankings in **2017 and 2018**. Similarly, **Toys** declined from **#4 in 2016 to #8 in 2017** before falling out of the top 10 in **2018**. Other categories, such as **Consoles & Games** and **Air Conditioning**, were present in the top 10 in **2016** but failed to reappear in subsequent years. Additionally, **Cool Stuff**, which entered the rankings at **#6 in 2017**, dropped to **#10 in 2018**, indicating a decline in popularity. These downward trends suggest potential market saturation or evolving consumer priorities.  

The analysis also highlighted categories with fluctuating performance, reflecting inconsistent growth. For example, **Automotive** ranked **#8 in 2016**, dropped out in **2017**, and reappeared at **#8 in 2018**. Similarly, **Baby Products** followed a comparable pattern, ranking **#10 in 2016**, disappearing in **2017**, and returning at **#9 in 2018**. **Garden & Tools** entered the rankings only in **2017 at #9**, but did not appear in **2016 or 2018**. These fluctuations suggest niche demand trends rather than sustained growth.  

In summary, the analysis underscores several key takeaways. **Health & Beauty** and **Watches & Gifts** demonstrated the strongest and most consistent growth over the three-year period. Meanwhile, **Bed, Bath & Table** and **Computers & Accessories** emerged as significant growth categories, reflecting shifting consumer priorities toward home and tech products. On the other hand, categories like **Perfumery** and **Toys** experienced notable declines, likely due to market saturation or changing trends. Finally, the inconsistent performance of certain categories, such as **Automotive** and **Baby Products**, suggests niche demand on consumer purchasing behavior.  

Category names in the dataset were originally formatted as `furniture_decor`, `health_beauty`, `perfumery`, `bed_bath_table`, `sports_leisure`, and `computers_accessories`, which were translated into user-friendly terms for clarity.  

### Revenue Insights

The results show that the top 10 categories accounted for 72.26% of total revenue in 2016, 62.89% in 2017, and 63.29% in 2018, indicating a high level of concentration in revenue distribution.

Growth Trends: The aggregate revenue of the top 10 categories was R$40,843.55 in 2016, R$4,489,034.04 in 2017, and R$5,469,522.96 in 2018, demonstrating a sharp increase. This suggests that while rankings shifted, overall revenue expanded significantly.

Data Limitations: The observed revenue gap between 2016 and subsequent years was due to partial data coverage (2016: Sept-Dec, 2018: Jan-Aug). This discrepancy was confirmed by analyzing order volume and timestamps, emphasizing the need to interpret revenue trends cautiously.

The analysis of top-selling product categories over the three-year period from 2016 to 2018 revealed several key trends, highlighting both consistent performers and shifting consumer preferences.

Among the most notable findings was the consistent performance of certain categories that maintained their presence in the top 10 rankings throughout all three years. Health & Beauty emerged as a standout category, steadily climbing from #3 in 2016 to #1 in 2018, solidifying its position as the leading category. Similarly, Watches & Gifts demonstrated continuous improvement, rising from #7 in 2016 to #2 in 2018. Sports & Leisure also performed consistently well, peaking at #3 in 2017 before settling at #4 in 2018. On the other hand, Furniture & Decor, which started as the top category in 2016, experienced a decline, dropping to #7 in 2017 and remaining there in 2018. These categories collectively demonstrated strong and sustained consumer demand over the period.

In summary, the analysis underscores several key takeaways. Health & Beauty and Watches & Gifts demonstrated the strongest and most consistent growth over the three-year period. Meanwhile, Bed, Bath & Table and Computers & Accessories emerged as significant growth categories, reflecting shifting consumer priorities toward home and tech products. On the other hand, categories like Perfumery and Toys experienced notable declines, likely due to market saturation or changing trends. Finally, the fluctuating performance of certain categories, such as Automotive and Baby Products, suggests niche demand on consumer purchasing behavior.

Given these timestamp limitations, the results for 2016 and 2018 may not fully reflect trends for an entire year, and should be interpreted with this in mind.

Category names in the dataset were originally formatted as furniture_decor, health_beauty, perfumery, bed_bath_table, sports_leisure, and computers_accessories, which were translated into user-friendly terms for clarity.

### Business Implications

- Health & Beautyâ€™s rise to #1 suggests strong consumer demand, making it a key category for promotional efforts and stock optimization.
- The surge in Bed, Bath & Table in 2017 highlights growing interest in home-related products, suggesting potential for targeted marketing campaigns.


It is important to note, however, that the 2016 data covers only a partial year (Septemberâ€“December), and the 2018 data spans Januaryâ€“August. As a result, rank movements should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, the flow of ranks 
Given these timestamp limitations, the results for 2016 and 2018 may not fully reflect trends for an entire year, and should be interpreted with this in mind.
