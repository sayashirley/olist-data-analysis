# SQL Queries Folder

This folder contains SQL scripts used to extract and analyze data directly from the dataset. Key scripts include:
- `calculate_revenue_by_category.sql`: SQL query to compute revenue across different product categories.
- `top_selling_categories.sql`: Identifies the top-selling categories based on sales volume and revenue.

Each query addresses specific questions about product category performance and aligns with the project objective.
